                                        I've held roles as CNC machine operators, technical quality focused roles for
                                        mechanical centric departments, and plant wide quality support in Engineering roles.
                                    <br>
                                        I have spent most of my career in the Printed Circuit Board industy and three years in
                                        the plastic machine and fabrication industy where I was a Manufacturing Engineer.
                                    <br>
                                        I realized I wanted to change my careers as I was tapped out in the engineering .
                                        tech / manufacturing engineering space. I taught myself to program starting with 
                                        Python and utilizing my companies Microsoft SQL server to build an  in house ERP 
                                        app that filled software gaps within the company. 
                                    <br>
                                        After teaching myself some programming I started taking classes at PCC eventually 
                                        transferring to PSU. In this time I moved into a Software Engineering role where 
                                        I develop code for Oracle at my current company and have been doing this job for 
                                        just over Three years.
