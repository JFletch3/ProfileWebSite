              I have worked in manufacturing environments for the last 18 years.
              I've held roles as CNC machine operators, technical quality
              focused roles for mechanical centric departments, and plant wide
              quality support in Engineering roles.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have spent most of my career in the Printed Circuit Board
              industy and three years in the plastic machine and fabrication
              industy where I was a Manufacturing Engineer.
              <br />
              <br />
              I realized I wanted to change my careers as I was tapped out in
              the engineering . tech / manufacturing engineering space. I taught
              myself to program starting with Python and utilizing my companies
              Microsoft SQL server to build an in house ERP app that filled
              software gaps within the company.
              <br />
              <br />
              After teaching myself some programming I started taking classes at
              Portland Community College eventually transferring to Portland
              Statue Univeristy. In this time I moved into a Software
              Engineering role where I develop code for Oracle at my current
              company and have been doing this job for just over Three years.
